                            <p>Borat's sense of humour derives from his mocking of society through outrageous sociocultural viewpoints, his violation of social taboos and use of vulgar language and behaviour. Entertainment Weekly put it on its end-of-the-decade, "best-of" list, saying, "The Kazakhstani journalist gave us some of the most incisive cultural commentary ever filmed. That, and a wrestling match between butt-naked men. Something for everyone."<br/><br/>
                              The character was first developed for short skits on F2F on Granada Television that Baron Cohen presented in 1996–1997, with the character at this time being known as Alexi Krickler. The character, now known as Kristo Shqiptari was picked up by Paramount Comedy 1 and subsequently by BBC Two's Comedy Nation. Alexi and Kristo were nearly identical in looks and demeanor to the later incarnation, although Alexi claimed to be Moldovan and Kristo claimed to be Albanian rather than from Kazakhstan. The character remained dormant while Baron Cohen concentrated on his Ali G persona for Channel 4's The 11 O'Clock Show, but with the subsequent success of Ali G and the creation of Da Ali G Show (also on Channel 4) Baron Cohen revisited his Borat character.</p>

                            <p>Admiral General Aladeen is the titular protagonist villain of the 2012 comedy film, The Dictator. He is the dictatorial President Prime Minister of the fictional North African country of Wadiya (also known as the Republic of Wadiya) and he will keep his power over his home country and never allow a democracy. As dictator, he had been authoritative, controlling, and tyrannical.<br/><br/>
                              For years, the North African Republic of Wadiya has been ruled by Admiral General Haffaz Aladeen, a childish, lecherous, tyrannical, provocative, misogynistic, anti-Western, and anti-Semitic despot who surrounds himself with female bodyguards, sponsors al-Qaeda and is working on developing nuclear weapons to attack Israel. After the United Nations Security Council resolves to intervene militarily, Aladeen travels to the UN Headquarters in New York City to address the council.</p>

                            <p>Ali G is a fictional stereotype of a British suburban male "chav" who imitates urban black British hip hop culture and British Jamaican culture, particularly through hip hop, reggae, drum and bass and jungle music, as well as speaking in rude boy-style English with borrowed expressions from Jamaican Patois. Ali G was part of a group called "Staines Massif", and grew up near Staines in Langley, Berkshire. He also lived part of his life in Staines (now called Staines-upon-Thames), north Surrey, 16 miles south-west of London. Baron Cohen has stated that BBC Radio 1 DJ Tim Westwood was an influence on the development of his character – Westwood used to host Radio 1's Rap Show and speaks in a faux Multicultural London English and hip hop dialect. Ali G's middle-class credentials mirror Westwood's: the latter was brought up in Lowestoft, Suffolk as a bishop's son.<br/><br/>

                                Prior to his character's first appearance on The 11 O'Clock Show, Baron Cohen had portrayed a similar character named MC Jocelyn Cheadle-Hume on a show he presented called F2F, which ran on the satellite channel Talk Tele (owned by Granada Television). While chatting to a group of skateboarders, in character, Baron Cohen realised that people could be led to believe his character was real, and filmed a number of segments which were ordered off-air by London Weekend Television</p>

                              <p>In May 2009, Brüno appeared at the MTV Movie Awards dressed as an angel with wings strapped to his buttocks hanging from the ceiling. As part of a prank, after an alleged equipment malfunction, he was lowered onto rapper Eminem who was seated directly beneath him. Brüno landed in Eminem's lap with his exposed rear end in Eminem's face. Members of D12, including Swifty, Kuniva, and Bizarre all helped to remove Brüno after Eminem said "Yo, get this motherfucker off me, man!" Eminem and the rest of the D12 members left the Awards, with Jesski shouting "Is the Real Slim Shady going to stand up?" Eminem appeared surprised, and slightly angry about the prank the whole time, but later claimed to reporters how he "laughed uncontrollably for about three hours" in his hotel afterward.Later Eminem himself claimed that the stunt had been planned and rehearsed beforehand; Baron Cohen had discussed the idea with Eminem, who is a fan of Baron Cohen's work and agreed to do the stunt.</p>

He demonstrates the use of unconventional tactics and technology in the fight against such enemies as terrorists, immigrants, and pedophiles. For example, he believes that the National Rifle Association's plan for arming school teachers does not go far enough to curtail gun violence and proposes a new program, "Kinderguardians", where children ages 3 to 16 are armed with guns. His military rank changes with each episode.</p>

                              <p>Nobby Butcher has been separated from his little brother Sebastian for 28 years. During their years apart, Nobby has become an alcoholic soccer hooligan and has started his own life with his girlfriend Dawn and his eleven children in the English seaport town of Grimsby.
                                  <br/><br/>
                                  Sebastianhas become one of MI6's top agents. After completing an interrogation, Sebastian comes into information regarding philanthropist Rhonda George, who is hosting a benefit called WorldCure and is a potential target for assassination, and is assigned to go. Nobby's friends at the pub also find out that his brother will be at WorldCure and convince Nobby to go there and reconnect with him. At the event, Sebastian sees a hitman, Pavel Lukashenko, who plans to assassinate Rhonda with a gun disguised as a video camera. As Sebastian prepares to shoot the camera, Nobby sees him and gives him a hug, accidentally causing him to shoot an AIDS-infected Jewish-Palestinian boy named Schlomo.</p>
